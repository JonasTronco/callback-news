Iâ€™m guessing Iâ€™m not the only one copy-pasting â€œgood communication skills, fast learner, stress resistanceâ€. Not because I was too lazy to think about it, but because I didnâ€™t think it matters. I always thought that technical skills are important for any tech position and of course, the same applies to anyone who handles production incidents. If a person has been working with java for 15 years and some python service crashes in production â€” it would probably take her more time to fix than anyone who has experience with python. And timing is super important during incident handling, so we would be checking only CVs of people with relevant python experience. This sounds logical but is actually completely incorrect. Soft skills matter as much or even more than technical skills for incident management. And in my opinion, theyâ€™re way more difficult to define in a job description, check during an interview and find in candidates. This post will help you address each of these difficulties.<p><a href=\"https://hackernoon.com/hiring-people-with-a-knack-for-incident-management-4e2f32qj?source=rss\">Read the full story</a></p>"
