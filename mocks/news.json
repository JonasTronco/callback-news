      "content": "Lexus commissioned the first “tattooed” car ever, and it’s chosen the UX as the tattoo artist’s canvas. Art cars and special projects catch our eye sometimes, but this particular project is one of the most intriguing works of art on a car we’ve seen in a long time. The process that tattoo artist Claudia de Sabe went through to translate her vision onto the UX is what we’re really interested in here.\r\n\r\nSince the UX is obviously a metal car, de Sabe needed to use a Dremel tool to drill away the blank white surface paint, exposing the bare metal underneath. Those painstakingly drilled lines were used as the pattern for the art taking shape. She had to be unerringly precise in her work. After all, there’s no magic eraser for drilling into a car’s metal body panels. Spending that much time free-drawing with a Dremel is intensive and demanding work, too. Comfortable positions are hard to come by, and a slip could be disastrous.\r\n\r\nAfter the pattern was drilled in, de Sabe switched to car paint and brushes. The koi fish and waves were painted on by hand, and then finally, de Sabe used gold leaf to create highlights in the paint and give it a stronger 3D effect. To protect the artwork, a layer of lacquer was applied, making it possible to drive this UX on the road.\r\n\r\nFrom the planning stages to the finished product, Lexus says it took six months. The in-studio work from de Sabe (and her tattoo artist husband who assisted her work) took place over five eight-hour days.\r\n\r\n“My main inspiration for the design of the car was just all the beautiful artwork that I’ve seen in Japan, in the temples, ukiyo-e prints, all of that artistic background,” de Sabe says.\r\n\r\nTattooing a car isn’t cheap either, as Lexus estimates this bespoke work would cost “upwards of £120,000” (about $140,000). Lexus made a video featuring de Sabe explaining her work and showing the “tattooing” in progress. It’s worth a quick watch, so check it out below.",

      "content": "Summer camp plans not coming together as you envisioned? Me neither. I have no idea what camp will look like for my 8- and 6-year old, and am leery of more Zoom time. I found an interesting possibility though, at least for my 8-year old: virtual robotics camp. More Zoom, yes, but Zoom with Robots!\r\n\r\nUBTECH Education, a division of UBTECH, the robotics company famous for its Walker robot and kids’ robot kits, teamed up with the STEM Learning Ecosystems Community of Practice to create Camp:ASPIRE for students ages 8 through 16.\r\n\r\nWhen campers sign up for a week, they get a  UKIT robotics building kit to keep that includes servos, connectors, a main control box, and 300-500+ pieces. They’ll also receive 10-plus hours of live virtual instruction from experienced educators. Campers can choose from basics in robotics, coding, and engineering to more advanced camps in animal robots and coding sensors. UBTECH Education also offers a toolkit for teachers looking for ways to share summer robotics with their students. Sessions begin June 15 and run through August 24. \r\n\r\nWith prices starting at $400 for a one-week session, Camp:ASPIRE isn’t cheap. But UBTECH Education and the STEM Learning Ecosystems Community of Practice, will commit a minimum of $100,000 in scholarships for the camp to help “kids attend who might otherwise be unable to access a robotics and engineering summer program.”\r\n\r\nWhile UBTECH’s Camp:Aspire is an interesting stay-at-home STEM option, it’s not the only game in town. Common Sense Media offers a great roundup of 15 Online “Camps” for kids that span everything from coding to game design. iDTech also has some online options for STEM summer camps. It’s also worth calling your local art and science centers to see if they have virtual camp options. No, it’s not the same as going to a physical summer camp. But, after the Zoom call is over, you can always eat ice cream and sit in the shade and watch birds and stuff.\r\n\r\nCamp: ASPIRE registration begins May 18.",

      "content": "At its virtual Build conference today, Microsoft announced it is launching industry-specific cloud offerings, starting with one designed for healthcare. Microsoft Cloud for Healthcare is now available in a public preview and as a free six-month trial. In general, the Industry Clouds are sets of tools that bring together Microsoft’s existing services like chatbots, Teams and Azure IoT. The company also promised that a “robust partner ecosystem” will be available to make the platform more useful.\r\n\r\nThink of Microsoft Industry Clouds as something like Google’s G Suite for businesses, except with access to far more Microsoft tools and catering specifically to designated industries. Cloud for Healthcare, for example, will focus on what Microsoft has identified as important needs for the field, like engaging patients, facilitating health team collaboration and improving operational efficiency, all with strict security measures.\r\n\r\nAn important component of healthcare is aftercare, where medical professionals need to keep in touch with patients to follow up on their recovery. But the tools available to do so are generally limited to follow-up phone calls and emails, which are not only tedious but can sometimes not meet security standards.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s Healthcare Bot Service will be available as a piece of this package, which the company said is behind more than 1,500 instances of COVID-19-based bots that have gone live since March. These bots can help alleviate the strain on emergency hotlines for medical providers while addressing common questions that people might have.\r\n\r\nAnother service Microsoft is making available is the Bookings app in its Teams collaboration platform, which will allow healthcare workers to schedule, manage and conduct provider-to-patient virtual visits without leaving Teams. Like most similar telehealth services today, Bookings (for Healthcare, at least) will send patients a customized email to go to their appointment in one click on a desktop, or in the Teams app on iOS or Android. A Microsoft spokesperson confirmed to Engadget that Teams “supports HIPAA compliance and is HITRUST certified.”\r\n\r\nCloud for Healthcare will also offer “enhanced patient engagement portals,” according to Microsoft, which lets patients and providers manage appointment booking, reminders and bill payments across various devices. Similar portals already exist, but Microsoft’s will likely make for a more seamless experience on the medical provider’s end since it can tie into other behind-the-scenes part of the infrastructure.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s service is also designed to make it easier for care teams to work across the many parts of America’s dizzying healthcare infrastructure. It includes tools for medical workers to easily create referrals, look up providers, as well as “understand physician spend, satisfaction and enhanced analytics on referral categories,” according to the company’s news release.\r\n\r\nWith Cloud for Healthcare, organizations can use Dynamics 365 Marketing and Customer Service tools to deploy individualized care plans for patients or groups of patients. Providers can also use the service to proactively reach out to patients on any device with preventative and care management programs, as well as conduct secure virtual visits and remote health monitoring via Azure IoT. The latter lets organizations receive data from medical devices to facilitate more-complete monitoring in real time so they can react quickly to emergency situations or escalate care in a timely manner, as well as reduce readmissions.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft will also offer an integration between Teams and Power Apps to help organizations create apps and workflows swiftly, without requiring a ton of code or weeks of work. According to the company, thousands of organizations are now relying on the new integration to manage their coronavirus response, including Swedish Health Services in Seattle, the Chicago Dept of Public Health and Rush Hospitals. Microsoft is also working with health system providers like Allscripts, GE Healthcare, Nuance, Epic and Adaptive Biotechnologies, as well as pharmacies and other medical organizations like Walgreens Boots Alliance, Humana and Novartis to allow easier collaboration across Cloud for Healthcare.\r\n\r\nIt’s clear that our healthcare infrastructure is about to evolve into a system facilitated by technology, and Microsoft wants to be a part of that movement with Cloud for Healthcare. Given the many moving pieces that make up America’s medical industry, it’s heartening to see a product that aims to make consolidating all those components easier.",

      "content": "In a recent episode of “60 Minutes,” a political talk show broadcast on Russian television, the hosts discussed the case against Maria Butina, the Russian gun activist who was recently released from prison in the U.S. after pleading guilty to conspiracy to act as a foreign agent. One of the co-hosts remarked that while the Americans charged Butina with spying, “all of it turned out to be nonsense.” Sympathetic to this interpretation of events, the studio audience erupted in applause.\r\n\r\nThe hourlong show — not to be confused with the venerable CBS program — airs weeknights on the state-owned Russia 1 television network, which boasts the second-largest viewership in the country. Episodes can also be watched on YouTube, where the channel has 353,000 subscribers. Under a policy YouTube instituted last year, a box should have appeared beneath the video about Butina, explaining that the program is “funded in whole or in part by the Russian government.” Earlier this week, it didn’t, potentially leading some viewers to mistake its nationalistic commentary for a nonpartisan news report.\r\n\r\nSuch omissions aren’t uncommon. A review by ProPublica shows that YouTube’s implementation of its policy to flag state-sponsored media channels has been haphazard, giving governments in Russia and elsewhere an opportunity to spread propaganda surreptitiously. The world’s most popular streaming service allowed 57 channels funded by the governments of Iran, Russia, China, Turkey and Qatar, among others, to play videos without labels.\r\n\r\nProPublica found the unlabeled channels by visiting the main pages of state-sponsored broadcasters, such as Russia 1, and following the links to other featured programs, such as “60 Minutes.” Many of the channels discovered by ProPublica played local news, investigative documentaries and political analysis, while others featured sports recaps, singing competitions, flamenco dancing and medical advice.\r\n\r\nThese unmarked channels suggest that YouTube has failed to prioritize its fight against disinformation, said Jennifer Grygiel, an assistant professor at Syracuse University who studies social media. “It’s a huge issue when people around the world don’t know when they’re interacting with media produced by governments,” Grygiel said. “When corporations like YouTube don’t have mandates in the form of regulation, how they enforce and enact their own policies will be less than stellar.”\r\n\r\nAfter ProPublica presented a list of the videos to YouTube, the company immediately labeled 35 of the 57 government-funded channels, including “60 Minutes.” A YouTube spokesperson said that the company’s efforts to label videos accurately are ongoing, and that it has invested heavily in improving the news experience for viewers.\r\n\r\nYouTube decided against labeling 22 channels identified by ProPublica, but it's not entirely clear why. A YouTube spokesperson said that they didn't meet its guideline that channels must be owned by \"news publishers\" in order to be labeled because they carried other types of content. Yet many government-funded news publishers offer a variety of news and non-news programs. For example, China Central Television is the country’s main news network, and videos from its news channels are labeled as “funded in whole or in part by the Chinese government,” but four of the CCTV sports and entertainment channels flagged by ProPublica remain unlabeled. Nor did the company label a handful of Russia-owned talk shows and cultural programs, which discussed news and historical events, such as the fall of the Berlin Wall. A YouTube spokesperson declined to clarify what counts as “a news publisher,” who makes that judgment, and how.\r\n\r\nYouTube rolled out contextual labels for state-funded media outlets in February 2018, amid criticism that the platform was promoting misinformation, propaganda and conspiracy theories. According to a YouTube spokesperson, a combination of machine learning and human reviewers has “identified and labeled hundreds of these channels.” Other social media platforms are following YouTube’s lead, with Facebook starting to label “state-controlled” media pages and advertisements this month.\r\n\r\nYouTube executives touted the additional context as part of the company’s effort to empower viewers to evaluate their news sources. In the wake of the 2016 election, the Google subsidiary had come under fire for facilitating the rise of RT. Formerly known as Russia Today and described by intelligence officials as “the Kremlin’s principal international propaganda outlet,” RT became one of the site’s most-watched news sources. (In 2013, RT was the first news channel on YouTube to reach 1 billion views.)\r\n\r\nNevertheless, several channels from RT escaped labeling. Among them is the channel for “451 Degrees,” a German-language talk show produced by RT, which has recently promoted false conspiracy theories about Chancellor Angela Merkel and the Hong Kong protests, respectively. According to the show, which has 44,700 subscribers and appears to take place in a basement, Merkel was a Stasi collaborator and the protests were engineered by Western powers.\r\n\r\nEleven channels funded by the U.S. government also weren’t labeled, including news reports from Al Hurra, part of the Middle East Broadcasting Network, whose channel has 256,000 subscribers. Videos from the main English-language page for Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty carry labels, but related channels promoted by the page, which feature Radio Liberty content in Russian, Bulgarian, Belorussian, Ukrainian and Croatian, did not. YouTube subsequently labeled all of the U.S. channels ProPublica brought to its attention.\r\n\r\nThe United States Agency for Global Media, or USAGM, which oversees the U.S.-funded international broadcasters Voice of America, Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty, Radio Free Asia and the Middle East Broadcasting Network that includes Al Hurra, had previously alerted YouTube to the erratic labeling of its content. According to Shawn Powers, USAGM’s chief strategy officer, the agency told YouTube this year that its policy was “not being implemented evenly across our networks and across others.”\r\n\r\nIn a July 2019 email to Google, which USAGM shared with ProPublica, the agency complained that outlets from North Korea, Iran and China were unlabeled. The Iranian channels were doing “direct messaging on behalf of the regime” and “spreading conspiracy theories,” USAGM said.\r\n\r\nYouTube declined to comment on its handling of USAGM’s concerns.\r\n\r\nThis month, Radio Liberty’s then-unlabeled Russian-language channel posted an hourlong documentary, “Only the Russian People Can Defeat Putin,” featuring interviews with notable dissidents, such as Garry Kasparov. To Americans, Radio Liberty’s reporting may seem uncontroversial, but Russian government mouthpieces have accused the network of advancing a misinformation campaign. Last December, amid rising tensions in Ukraine, the hosts of “60 Minutes” lampooned the American-funded outlet for suggesting that the war in the Donbass region of eastern Ukraine was the result of Russian aggression. A commentator on the program, dissenting from the Kremlin’s spin, implored viewers to find out the truth for themselves, shouting, “Open up YouTube!”\r\n\r\nLapses in YouTube’s labeling have been pointed out publicly before. In February 2018, shortly after the labeling began, the Committee to Protect Journalists noticed that out of 37 state-funded public media outlets on YouTube, 18 channels lacked labels. This past June, Reuters reported that 14 Russian-backed YouTube channels with millions of views had not been properly identified as state-sponsored. Following inquiries from Reuters, YouTube subsequently labeled 13 of them.\r\n\r\nIn August, YouTube’s labeling feature, already available in the U.S., India and much of Western Europe, was introduced in Hong Kong. Some journalists were dismayed that outlets such as the BBC — which is publicly funded but editorially independent — were labeled along with Chinese government stations that denounced the recent anti-government protests. YouTube, for its part, says it doesn’t judge the quality or objectivity of news content. It notes that “the information panel providing publisher context is based on information about the news publisher made available by Wikipedia and other independent third-party sources. It is not a comment by YouTube on the publisher’s or video’s editorial direction, or on a government’s editorial influence.”\r\n\r\nThat explanation hasn’t satisfied public broadcasters, like PBS and the BBC, which have criticized YouTube for labeling them despite their editorial independence. YouTube describes PBS as an “American public broadcast service” and the BBC as “a British public broadcast service.”\r\n\r\nUSAGM has objected to YouTube’s labels on the grounds that they conflate editorially independent media, like Voice of America, with outlets like RT.\r\n“Part of me says congratulations to social media platforms for taking this on seriously, and I don’t want to understate how hard it is to get those policies right,” Powers said. “But this mischaracterizes our network, which is editorially independent by law.”\r\n\r\nRT isn’t happy either. Anna Belkina, RT’s deputy editor in chief, said that the labels create a double standard. Privately funded channels, Belkina said in an email, are viewed “as somehow superior, agenda-less, unbiased and more legitimate than publicly funded counterparts — solely on the basis of their funding structure, which lets them avoid any labeling whatsoever. The public is being coerced into a biased Google world view, rather than being able to judge content on its merits.”\r\n\r\nYouTube’s difficulties are merely the latest example of a global communications platform struggling with the definition of propaganda and the implications of profiting from it. In August, Facebook and Twitter accepted money from Chinese state-run media outlets to feature ads that appeared to discredit the Hong Kong protesters. Following the negative press, Twitter said that it would refuse advertisements from state-media organizations that lacked editorial autonomy.\r\n\r\nYouTube says it is redoubling its efforts against disinformation as the 2020 election approaches, in part by promoting more authoritative content in search results and appending links to “credible sources, including Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia” for videos on topics vulnerable to conspiracy theories. To some social media researchers, the labeling mishaps bode ill for these other initiatives. “I think YouTube is doing this right,” Grygiel added. “But they’re not doing this well.”",
